# Portfolio

Technologies used:
  - HTML: used for addition of text elements and some container elements.
  - CSS: I used a lot of CSS in this project as I felt I was lacking in this area. I used flex boxes and grids for displaying projects and I got a lot more comfortable with the box model.
  - JavaScript and jQuery: I used mostly jQuery for this project for the creation and functionality of buttons and icons. I used one JS built-in feature, scrollIntoView.

Approach:

  1. I started off this project by drawing wireframes. I decided to have one main page with several sections on it like About Me, Projects, etc, and a sticky nav bar that scrolls to the section that is clicked on. I chose this design based on looking at other developer portfolios and it makes sense given the lack of content for most of the pages/sections.
  2. I started by making some un-styled HTML for the sections.
  3. Then I added the sticky nav bar with the drop down menu that scrolls the clicked on section into view. This was probably the most difficult task of the project.
  4. Then added more content to the page with a combination of HTML and jQuery. The projects section of the page was difficult because I added a "show more" button and displayed the projects in flexboxes.
  5. I finished up with a lot of styling and some responsive design. I did some styling to the buttons in the nav bar so that they change color when they are hovered over and the show more projects button has an animation to grow its border on hover too. The page could definitely look better in terms of pictures and color scheme but I'm happy with the functionality.

Unsolved Problems/Areas of Improvement:
  - I tried a mobile first design and I like the way the site looks when it is small but as it is dragged out it gets corrected but it doesn't look as good so I may want to move the nave bar to the side as it grows it the future.
  - Another big problem is just lack of content. I don't have a lot of projects to display so the site doesn't look very official.
