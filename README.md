Technologies used:
  - HTML: used for addition of text elements and some container elements.
  - CSS: I used a lot of CSS in this project as I felt I was lacking in this area. I used flex boxes and grids for displaying projects and I got a lot more comfortable with the box model.
  - JavaScript and jQuery: I used mostly jQuery for this project for the creation and functionality of buttons and icons. I used on JS built in feature, scrollIntoView.

Approach:

  1. I started off this project by drawing wireframes of what I wanted the site to look like and then adding unstyled HTML to the page.
  2. Then I added the fixed nav bar with the drop down menu that scrolls the clicked on section into view. This was probably the most difficult task of the project.
  3. Then more content to the page with a combination of HTML and jQuery. The projects section of the page was difficult because I added a "show more" button and displayed the projects in flexboxes.
  4. I finished up with a lot of styling and some responsive design. The page could definitely look better in terms of pictures and color scheme but I'm happy with the functionality.

Unsolved Problems/Areas of Improvement:
  - I tried a mobile first design and I like the way the site looks when it is small but as it is dragged out it gets corrected but it doesn't look as good so I may want to move the nave bar to the side as it grows it the future.
  - Another big problem is just lack of content. I don't have a lot of projects to display so the site doesn't look very official.
